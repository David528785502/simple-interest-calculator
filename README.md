# Simple Interest Calculator

This project is a simple interest calculator that computes the simple interest based on principal, rate of interest, and time.

## Formula

Simple Interest (SI) is calculated using the formula:

SI = (P × R × T) / 100

Where:
- P = Principal amount
- R = Rate of interest per year
- T = Time in years

## Example

If:
- Principal = 1000
- Rate = 5%
- Time = 2 years

Then:
- Simple Interest = (1000 × 5 × 2) / 100 = 100

## Usage

This calculator can be used to understand how simple interest works for basic financial calculations.
